# SCIANN: EEG-Based Empathy Recognition

This repository provides the PyTorch implementation for EEG-based empathy recognition tasks.

* **SCIANN was tested on the following datasets and achieved SOTA results**:
1.  A **private dataset** from a two-person collaborative motor imagery experiment.
2.  The **public ECSU-PCE dataset** focused on social touch interactions.

## Tasks Supported

The codebase allows training and evaluation for the following classification tasks:

* **On Self-Collected Data:**
    * **Empathy Presence Detection:** Binary classification (e.g., distinguishing friend vs. stranger interactions).
    * **Empathy Type Recognition:** 4-class classification (distinguishing interaction conditions).

* **On ECSU-PCE Public Data:**
    * **Social Perception Classification:** Binary classification based on Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS) scores (e.g., distinguishing high vs. low perceived presence/empathy).

## The related paper of this model was published in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics(JBHI), titled EEG-based Spatial-Channel Interaction Attention Neural Networks for Detecting Empathy in Motor Collaboration, which is currently in early access, doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2025.3580617
